Given a video of traffic find and track all cars in it.

Goal : 

- Design a processing pipeline: Main concern is the speed of processing, memory usage and task independence.
- Think carefully whether consecutive tasks can be run in parallel (please use multithreading).
Detection and tracking: should use separate algorithms. one for detection and one for tracking.

- Provide a report:
    - what was the total number of cars (track number)
    - distribution of track life time (time from initialization to termination)
    - avg CPU and memory usage
    - what is the time it takes a video frame to travel through the entire pipeline?
